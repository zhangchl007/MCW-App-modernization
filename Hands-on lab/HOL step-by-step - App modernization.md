# App modernization hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement the steps to modernize a legacy on-premises application, including upgrading and migrating the application and the database to Azure and updating the application to take advantage of serverless and cloud services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, your ability to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services will be improved.

## Overview

Parts Unlimited is an online auto parts store. Founded in Spokane, WA, in 2008, they are providing both genuine OEM and aftermarket parts for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and trucks, including new and remanufactured complex parts, maintenance items, and accessories. Its mission is to make buying vehicle replacement parts easy for consumers and professionals. Parts Unlimited has 185 stores in the US, with plans to scale to Mexico and Brazil.

Parts Unlimited has a hosted web application on its internal infrastructure and using a Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server to host the solution. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in hardware, operating system updates, and licensing fees. These maintenance costs make Microsoft Azure App Service an attractive alternative. Their team is looking to migrate Microsoft ASP.NET applications and any SQL Server database to Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database. However, they are worried that their application might not be supported. Their website is built on a .NET Core version that hit the end of life on December 23, 2019. They wonder if they can move to the cloud now and migrate their application later or if the old version will be a show stopper.

Additionally, Parts Unlimited has plans to increase its marketing investment, currently on hold because of scaling issues. The company is stuck and can't grow without increasing its infrastructure footprint. Their CEO wants to finalize their cloud vs. on-premises decision based on the current migration effort's success. The engineering team is worried about their order processing subsystem. Currently, they have a strongly coupled order processing system that runs synchronously during checkout. When moved to the cloud, they don't want to be worried about their order processing system's scalability. They are looking for a modern approach with the least migration effort possible.

Finally, Parts Unlimited is looking to invest in DevOps practices to decrease human error in deployments. They are looking for options to have a staging environment to test functionality before shipping to production. However, their team does not have any experience in building CI/CD pipelines. They are not sure if this goal is achievable in the short term, and they do not want it to hold up their migration to the cloud.

## Solution architecture

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution you implement in this hands-on lab. Please review this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a high-level overview of the architecture implemented within this hands-on lab.](media/architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

The solution begins with setting up Azure Migrate as the central assessment and migration hub for Parts Unlimited's E-Commerce website. Using the App Service Migration Assistant tool from Azure Migrate, Parts Unlimited found that their website is fully compatible with Azure App Service. As a next step, they use App Service Migration Assistant to provision an Azure App Service environment and deploy their application to Azure. Following the success in moving the web application, Parts Unlimited uses the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) assessment to determine that they can migrate into a fully-managed SQL Database service in Azure. The assessment reveals no compatibility issues or unsupported features that would prevent them from using Azure SQL Database.

Next, Parts Unlimited sets up a private GitHub repository and pushes their codebase to GitHub. They set up deployment slots to have a staging environment to test functionality before releasing to production. As a CI/CD solution, they decide to use GitHub Actions and Workflows.

Finally, Parts Unlimited decides to decouple its order processing system and move to an event-driven serverless compute platform. Following a [web-queue-worker architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/web-queue-worker), they build an Azure Function and use Azure Storage Queue to process orders and create invoices asynchronously. When new orders come in, the web front end adds jobs into the queue consumed by Azure Functions. The Functions App scales independently based on the number of jobs in the queue, helping Parts Unlimited elastically handle a variable amount of orders.

## Requirements

## Exercise 2: Migrate your application with App Service Migration Assistant

Duration: 20 minutes

The first step for Parts Unlimited is to assess whether their apps have dependencies on unsupported features on Azure App Service. In this exercise, you use an **Azure Migrate** tool called the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to evaluate Parts Unlimited's website for a migration to Azure App Service. The assessment runs readiness checks and provides potential remediation steps for common issues. Once the assessment succeeds, we will proceed with the migration as well. You will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform assessment for migration to Azure App Service

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their application to Azure App Service. You will use the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to assess the application and run various readiness checks.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **WebVM** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **WebVM** VM from the list of resources.

    ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png "WebVM Selection")

2. On the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview (1)** blade, copy the **Public IP address (2)**.

## Exercise 3: Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 55 minutes

The next step of Part Unlimited's migration project is the assessment and migration of its database. Currently, the database lives on a SQL Server 2008 R2 on a virtual machine. You will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** tool called **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database for a migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** service called **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**. During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: The Database Migration Assistant is already installed on your SqlServer2008 VM. It can be downloaded through Azure Migrate or from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090807) as well.

1. Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP. Your credentials are the same as the WebVM , `demouser` with `Password.1!!` password.

   ![The SQLServer2008 virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/find-sqlserver2008-resource.png "SqlServer2008 Selection")

2. Launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the migration assistant, install it from the `c:\DataMigrationAssistant.msi` file.

    > **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard-to-read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, allowing you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

3. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

4. In the New project pane, set the name of the project **(1)** and make sure the following value are selected:

   - **Project type**: Select Assessment.
   - **Project name (1)**: Enter **Assessment**.
   - **Assessment type**: Select Database Engine.
   - **Source server type**: Select SQL Server.
   - **Target server type**: Select Azure SQL Database.

   ![New project settings for doing an assessment of a migration from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.](media/dma-new-project-to-azure-sql-db.png "New project settings")

5. Select **Create (2)**.

6. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility (1)** and **Check feature parity (1)** are both checked, and then select **Next (2)**.

   ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

7. On the **Sources** screen, select **Add sources**.

11. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-azure-sql-db.png "Start assessment")

12. Take a moment to review the assessment for migrating to Azure SQL DB. The SQL Server feature parity report **(1)** shows that Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services are unsupported **(2)**, but these do not affect any objects in the `PartsUnlimited` database, so they won't block a migration.

    ![The feature parity report is displayed, and the two unsupported features are highlighted.](media/dma-feature-parity-report.png "Feature parity")

13. Now, select **Compatibility issues (1)** so you can review that report as well.

    ![The Compatibility issues option is selected and highlighted.](media/dma-compatibility-issues.png "Compatibility issues")

    The DMA assessment for migrating the `PartsUnlimited` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB reveals that no issues or features are preventing Parts Unlimited from migrating their database to Azure SQL DB.

6. The Parts Unlimited website's source code is already copied into the VM as part of the **Before the hands-on lab exercises**. Run the command below to navigate to the source code folder.

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src"
    ```

7. Run the following command to initialize a local Git repository.

    ```powershell
    git init
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git init is highlighted and executed.](media/git-init.png "Git init")

8. Next, we will define the remote endpoint as an origin to our local repository. Replace `{YourEndpointURL}` with the endpoint URL you copied previously from GitHub. Run the final command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git remote add origin {YourEndpointURL}
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git remote add origin is highlighted and executed. ](media/git-remote-add.png "Git remote add")

9. Run the following commands to rename the current branch to **Main** and stage all the files for a git commit.

    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    git add .
    ```

10. Before we commit our changes, we have to identify our git user name and e-mail. In the following command, replace `John Doe` with your name and `johndoe@example.com` with your e-mail address. Once ready, run the command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

11. We are ready to commit the source code to our local Git repository. Run the following command to continue.

    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

12. Let's push our code to GitHub. Run the following command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
    ```

13. GitHub authentication screen will pop up. Select **Sign in with your browser (2)**. A new browser pop-up will appear with the GitHub login page.

    ![Deployment Settings page is open. The source is set to GitHub. Runtime stack is set to .NET Core. Version is set to .NET Core 2.1 (LTS). Authorize button for GitHub is highlighted. ](media/app-service-deployment-settings.png "Deployment Center Settings")

4. Login with your GitHub credentials and provide authorization to App Service to access the repository by selecting **Authorize AzureAppService**.

    ![Authorize AzureAppService button is highlighted.](media/app-service-github-repo-access.png "Authorize Azure App Service")

5. Once GitHub authorization is complete, go back to the browser with the Azure Portal. Select the GitHub **Organization (1)** where you created the GitHub repository. This might be your personal account name if that is where you created the repository. Select the repository **partsunlimited (2)** and the branch **main (3)** as the source for the CI/CD pipeline. Select **Save (4)** to create CI/CD pipeline.

    ![Authorize AzureAppService button is highlighted.](media/app-service-cicd-settings-save.png "Deployment Center Settings")

    Once you select **Save**, the portal will add your App Service publishing profile as a secret to your GitHub repository. This will allow GitHub Actions to publish the Parts Unlimited website to the staging deployment slot. Additionally, the portal will create a YAML file that describes the steps required to build and publish the code in the partsunlimited repository.

6. Visit your GitHub repository on GitHub.com to look for changes. Navigate to `.github/workflows` **(1)** to see the **YAML file (2)** and the commit **(3)** made to the repository on your behalf.

    ![Partsunlimited repository is open on GitHub.com. .github/workflows folder is shown. A new commit that includes a main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml file is highlighted.](media/github-inital-yaml-commit.png "GitHub Actions worklfow")

7. Select **Actions (1)** to navigate to the Actions page where you can see the list of workflow runs on the repository. Noticed that the latest run has failed **(2)**. Select the failed run (2) to investigate the issue.

    ![GitHub Actions for the repository is open](media/github-actions-failed.png "Github Actions")

8. Select the failed job to dig deeper.

    ![Details for the GitHub workflow run are shown. A failed job named build-and-deploy is highlighted.](media/github-actions-failed-net-core-version.png "GitHub Actions failed build")

9. In the error message, we can see a mismatch between the .NET Core version the build job is using and the one the project is built against. When we set up our CI/CD pipeline, the Azure Portal listed .NET Core LTS (Long Term Support) versions only. Unfortunately, Parts Unlimited uses a .NET Core version that hit the end of life on December 23, 2019. We will have to change our pipeline setup manually to accommodate project requirements.

    ![Build-and-deploy job error message is shown. SDK version requirement 2.2.207 is highlighted.](media/github-actions-version-error.png "Build Error")

10. Select **Code (1)** to switch back to the repository code view. Select **.github/workflows (2)** to navigate to the location where the workflow YAML code is stored.

    ![The main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml file is on screen. Edit this file button is highlighted.](media/github-yaml-edit.png "Workflow YAML Editing")

13. We have to change the **dotnet-version (1)** number to `2.2.207`. Additionally, we have to add the solution file name **(2)** and the project file name **(3)** to dotnet build and publish commands. The reason behind this change is the fact that Parts Unlimited has multiple solutions and projects in its codebase.

    ![main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml is open in edit mode. dotnet-version is set to 2.2.207. dotnet build command is changed to include PartsUnlimited.sln as a parameter. dotnet publish command is changed to include src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/PartsUnlimitedWebsite.csproj as a parameter.](media/github-yaml-commit.png "GitHub YAML Editing")

    Here is the final YAML file that you can use if needed.

## Exercise 5: Using serverless Azure Functions to process orders

Duration: 30 minutes

With its migration to Azure, Parts Unlimited plans to launch a series of campaigns to increase its sales. Their current architecture is processing purchase orders synchronously and is coupled with their front end. Parts Unlimited is looking for ways to decouple its order processing system and make sure it can scale independently from the web front end when orders increase.

You suggest a serverless approach that can handle order processing and the creation of invoices for processed orders. In this exercise, you will deploy a serverless Azure Function that will listen to an Azure Storage Queue and process orders as they come. Parts Unlimited has already implemented the changes required to push the jobs into a queue of your choice.
